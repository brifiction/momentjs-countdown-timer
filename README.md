# momentjs-countdown-timer

A simple countdown timer, using `moment` with `jquery` and the `parcel-bundler`.

## summary 

It makes life simple, as it requires zero configuration. 

Modify and make changes to the `main.js` file and `index.html` to start customizing / testing etc.

> `npm run dev`

This script will compile all defined assets into the `dist` folder, then runs dev server on `localhost:1234` (as defined in the package.json).

Run `yarn install` or `npm install` <br>
Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to have all bundled in the `dist` folder. <br>
